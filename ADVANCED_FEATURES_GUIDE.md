```

### 4. Controlled Health Record Sharing
**Database**: `shared_records` table
**Features**:
- Selective record sharing with doctors
- Expiry-based access control
- Access tracking and analytics
- Sharing history for patients
- Revokable permissions

### 5. Enhanced Medical Records
**Database**: Extended `medical_records` table
**New Features**:
- Doctor/hospital uploaded records tracking
- Enhanced AI analysis with Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Confidence scoring for AI analysis
- Structured data extraction
- Multi-format file support

## 🚧 Database Migration Required

Run the following SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- File: enhanced-features-migration.sql
-- This creates all the new tables and columns needed
```

## 📱 Frontend Integration

### Update Main Dashboard
Add the new components to your main dashboard:

```tsx
// In src/app/dashboard/page.tsx
import PersonalVault from '@/components/dashboard/PersonalVault';
import QRCodeManager from '@/components/dashboard/QRCodeManager';
import EnhancedAppointments from '@/components/dashboard/EnhancedAppointments';

// Add new tabs for the features
const dashboardTabs = [
  { id: 'overview', label: 'Overview', icon: Home },
  { id: 'records', label: 'Medical Records', icon: FileText },
  { id: 'vault', label: 'Personal Vault', icon: Shield },
  { id: 'appointments', label: 'Appointments', icon: Calendar },
  { id: 'qr-codes', label: 'QR Codes', icon: QrCode },
  { id: 'profile', label: 'Profile', icon: User }
];
```

### Environment Variables
Add to your `.env.local`:
```
# For enhanced AI analysis
GEMINI_API_KEY_2_5=your_gemini_2.5_flash_api_key

# For QR code generation (optional)
QR_CODE_API_URL=your_qr_service_url

# For video appointments (optional)
VIDEO_CALL_API_KEY=your_video_service_key
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Personal Vault Security
- Files encrypted at rest in Supabase Storage
- Additional password layer for sensitive documents
- Row-level security policies implemented
- Audit trail for all access attempts

### QR Code Security
- MED ID data encrypted before QR generation
- Time-based expiry for QR codes
- Scan tracking and rate limiting
- Secure transmission of patient data

### Sharing Controls
- Patient-controlled access permissions
- Time-based access expiry
- Granular sharing (specific records vs. full access)
- Audit logs for all sharing activities

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Notes

### File Upload Enhancements
```typescript
// Enhanced file upload with virus scanning
const uploadWithSecurity = async (file: File) => {
  // 1. Virus scan
  // 2. File type validation
  // 3. Size limits
  // 4. Encryption
  // 5. Storage with metadata
};
```
